# Effect v4 (Beta) - Development & Migration

## Overview

Comprehensive guidance for Effect v4 development and migration from v3. This skill provides:

1. **v4 Core Patterns** - Guide to building new v4 code with `Context`, layers, generators, schema codecs
2. **v3 → v4 Migration** - Step-by-step migration guidance with API renames, behavior changes, and before/after examples

**Status:** Effect v4 is beta software under active development in [effect-smol](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol). The core programming model is stable, but `effect/unstable/*` modules may receive breaking changes in minor releases. For production use, review official v4 beta guidance and stability notes.

All bundled migration guides are sourced from the official effect-smol migration documentation.

## Upstream Changes Since February 22, 2026

The upstream beta changed substantially after this skill was last refreshed. Treat older examples that mention `ServiceMap` or `Schema.makeUnsafe` as stale. Current guidance should prefer:

- `Context.Service` / `Context.Reference` / `Context<R>` instead of `ServiceMap.*`
- `Schema.make(...)` instead of `Schema.makeUnsafe(...)`
- `Schema.makeEffect(...)` when constructor-style validation should fail in the error channel instead of throwing

## Quick Triage

### Migrating from v3

- Full migration overview, quick-reference table, ordered checklist: `references/migration.md`
- Runtime and run functions: `references/migration/runtime.md`
- Error handling and error channel changes: `references/migration/error-handling.md`
- Cause flattening and new structure: `references/migration/cause.md`
- Services and environment changes (`Context.Tag` / `Effect.Service` → `Context.Service`): `references/migration/services.md`
- Fiber references and context locals: `references/migration/fiberref.md`
- Forking and fiber APIs (fork → forkChild, etc.): `references/migration/forking.md`
- Fiber keep-alive behavior changes: `references/migration/fiber-keep-alive.md`
- Scope and resource lifecycle patterns: `references/migration/scope.md`
- Layer memoization and Layer.fresh: `references/migration/layer-memoization.md`
- Generator and Effect.gen changes: `references/migration/generators.md`
- Yieldable protocol (non-Effect yieldables): `references/migration/yieldable.md`
- Equality and structural comparison: `references/migration/equality.md`

## Workflow

1. Ask which v3 APIs or files are in scope and which failures or regressions to avoid.
2. Open only the relevant migration notes from `references/migration/`.
3. Produce a mapping of v3 to v4 APIs, including before/after code snippets.
4. Call out behavior changes, edge cases, and test updates needed.
5. Provide a short, ordered migration checklist tailored to the code in question.

## Source of Truth

- Start with the bundled references in this skill.
- If the question depends on newer beta behavior, check the official docs and `effect-smol` changelogs next.
- Only inspect `effect-smol` source internals when the docs/changelogs are ambiguous, the user is asking about internals, or the behavior appears undocumented.
- Do not clone or read the repo source by default when the bundled references or official docs already answer the question.

## Example Requests

- "Migrate this v3 `Runtime` usage to v4 and explain the new run functions."
- "Update our v3 error handling to v4 and show before/after examples."
- "We use FiberRefs and forking; what needs to change in v4?"
- "Explain the generator/yieldable changes and update this Effect.gen usage."
- "Do we need to change any Scope or Layer memoization behavior in v4?"
